<h1 align="center">General Gielinor Game</h1>

I have created this project (Milestone project 2) as part of my Full Stack Web Development course with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).

General Gielinor Game is an interactive quiz designed to help you improve your knowledge about the game [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com). I have been playing this game since 2001 and have such acquired a lot of game knowledge, so I thought what better idea for a interactive game?

## User Experience Design

### Project Goals

The idea is to create an interactive general knowledge game about [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com/) an MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role playing game). The game will help players gain more knowledge of the game and when a correct answer is given they are present with the reasoning behind the question and why it is correct. There are no wrong answers but you won't be punished for learning. It's a crucial part of understanding any concept, we are all learing everyday, including me. As a veteran player myself, I have an abundance of Runescape knowledge and I hope to inspire players to learn more about the game.

## Deployment

### Project Inception

1. This project was created using [GitHub](https://github.com) and Code Institutes project template [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by clicking "Use this template".
2. I named this project "general-gielinor game" as it is the name of the quiz on the website.
3. Once the repository had been created I clicked the "Gitpod" button which is a Firefox extension ([here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/)) that creates a workspace within GitPod which is where I coded the project.
4. Following [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) lessons the 4 main commands I used were:
    + ```git status``` (which allows me to check which files have been modified and if any are ready to be committed)
    + ```git add .``` (which adds all changed files within my project's directory to be committed)
    + ```git commit -m "[TYPE] Reason"``` (which commits all changes to my project using a category prefix and a specific reason for that commit)
    + ```git push``` (this command pushes all committed changes to the live version of my site on Github Pages)
