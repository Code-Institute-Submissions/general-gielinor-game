## Testing

### 

+ When trying to get the answers to display correctly I was originally using a standard for loop. (`for (i=0;i<answers.length;i++)`). After a few hours of attempts of trying to get my dataSet to import and load correctly. I decided to look into other methods of providing this functionality.
    + I have included within the credits section of my README.md how I went about fixing this bug using the array function forEach.
